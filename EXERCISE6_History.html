        <h1>CASA DE SEGUNDA: Meeting Jose Rizal’s First Love in Lipa City, Batangas</h1>  
        <br>
        <img src="30.png" width="60%" height="auto">
        <p class="aboutBody">It was love at first sight. That’s exactly how I felt when I first laid eyes on Casa de Segunda, also known as Luz-Katigbak Ancestral House. From the balcony overlooking the garden, I could see the many interesting shapes and patterns around the place. It was my first time here. While I had been to many of Lipa’s tourist destinations before, I had no idea that this place existed prior to this trip. I learned about it while preparing for this tour. We struggled to find it but we did not give up on our search. And boy was I grateful. It was a place to fall in love with.</p>
                <br>
        <p>The ancestral house of the Luz-Katigbak family, Casa de Segunda is named after Segunda Solis Katigbak, widely regarded as the first love of national hero Jose Rizal. Born to Don Norberto Kalaw Katigbak, the gobernadorcillo from 1862-83, and Dona Justa Metra Solis, Segunda grew up in a prominent family and was sent to Manila to study. She attended Colegio de la Concordia in Sta. Ana, Manila, where she became classmates with Dona Olympia Rizal. At a party to which she was invited, Segunda met Jose Rizal, who was easily smitten. Swooning over her, Jose sent her poems, sketches and flowers. She was only fourteen years old at the time. 
                In one of Rizal’s biographies, Rizal was quoted saying that although Segunda was not the most beautiful woman he had seen, she was definitely the most alluring and beguiling. He was saddened, however, that she was set to get married to a relative — Manuel Metra Luz, who also came from a prominent family in Lipa.</p>
